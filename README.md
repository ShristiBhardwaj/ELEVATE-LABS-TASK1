# ELEVATE-LABS-TASK1
This repository contains task 1 of my internship  with elevate labs
In here we have amazon sales data generated via chatgpt.
I've checked for the null values and as the number of null values were large, i decided to replace them and not drop them.
I also standardize all data by stripping white spaces and converting them to lowercase.
Made a standard fromat for order date column
dropped duplicates
